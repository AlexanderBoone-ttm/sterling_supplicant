Laird Sterling Supplicant

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the Sterling Supplicant:
Details for building wpa_supplicant are provided in ./wpa_supplicant/README.

The Makefile in this directory is provided to assist with building
using a cross-compiler toolchain that has gcc and pkg-config.
The toolchain pkg-config must provide libnl3, dbus-1, and xml2.

Invoke the cross-compiler build using:
       $ make CC=cross-compiler-toolchain-prefix-gcc
The Makefile will:
    - verify the toolchain compiler is availble
    - verify the toolchain pkg-config is available
    - copy configuration file <config_laird> to ../wpa_supplicant/.config
    - invoke the ../wpa_supplicant/Makefile with "clean"
    - invoke the ../wpa_supplicant/Makefile
Output files will be found in ../wpa_supplicant.
A symbol stripped copy of wpa_supplicant will be in the laird directory.

Native builds are also supported by leaving out the CC option:
       $ make
Output files will be found in ../wpa_supplicant.

The make command line may also specify a specific component:
For example, to build just wpa_supplicant:
       $ make CC=cross-compiler-toolchain-prefix-gcc wpa_supplicant
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Typical make failures/errors:

>> ERROR: cannot find compiler: cross-compiler-gcc
Compiler name is mistyped, or is not on the path.

>> ERROR: cannot find pkg-config: cross-compile-path/cross-compiler-pkg-config
pkg-config cannot be found for the cross compiler toolchain.
May be able to proceed by specifying PKG_CONFIG=pkg-config-with-full-path

>> ERROR: cannot find objcopy: cross-compiler-objcopy
objcopy cannot be found for the cross compiler toolchain

>> fatal error: dbus/dbus.h: No such file or directory
A toolchain library may be missing or not supported from pkg-config.

   For specific missing include files:
   <dbus/dbus.h> - dbus library is missing
   <dbus/*>
        - add the missing dbus library to the toolchain
        - OR disable dbus in the configuration
          by commenting out the following in <config_laird>
                CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE_DBUS_NEW=y
                CONFIG_CTRL_IFACE_DBUS_INTRO=y
          (Note, this will disable control through network manager)

   <netlink/genl/genl.h> - netlink (libnl) library is missing
   <netlink/*>
        - add the missing netlink library to the toolchain
        - in this case, disabling use of netlink is not an option

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Laird Sterling Supplicant is based on wpa_supplicant-2.6.
Supplicant source changes:
- Laird version number
- laird directory - readme, makefile, build configuration
- BZ14773: EAP-FAST authentication fails if ACS server is not configured
  to allow authenticated provisioning

To get a complete list of differences, excluding the laird directory:
   $ git diff hostap_2_6 -- . ':!laird'

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Laird Directory
The laird directory includes the following:
- README - this text file
- config_laird - build configuration for the sterling supplicant
- Makefile - makefile for building the sterling supplicant
